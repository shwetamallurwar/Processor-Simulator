Simple Pipeline
===============

Steps to execute the Simple Pipeline Simulator:

1) Important point, Add two EOF instructions at the end of input program file.
   EOF instructions are used to identify end of program. Program will run into
   infinite loop if you dont add the EOF instructions at the end of program.
   One can find sample example in samples directory.

2) How to compile the project?

   1) goto ~/sim/src directory.
   
   2) execute the command "make all" in the current directory. This command 
   will compile the project.

3) Simulator expects memory dump to be in big endien mode, one can find WriteMemory
   java program in tools directory to generate memory dump in big endien mode.

   Simulator is using abstract window toolkit to display memory & registers contents, 
   make sure DISPLAY variable is set or you are on local linux machine.


4) How to run the project?
   simulator expects four file names as input argument. Make sure all the input files 
   are in the ~/sim/src/. directory.

   To run the project execute following command:

   ./sim_t.sh arch_param_file_name init_mem_file_name assembly_file_name output_file_name

   (All the input files should be in ~/src/. directory)

   Program generates lots of information on command prompt. At the end,output_file will be 
   generated with the results. Output file contains (CPI,# of clock cycle, # of stalls,
   # of instructions executed).
   
   Memory contents will be displayed in JFrame Window. Memory is implemented as array of Bytes.

    
5) How to exit from the simulator?

  Once execution is finished result is displayed at console and written into output file.
  To show the contents of Memory and registers in JFrame, i have suspended the main thread.
  Once execution is finished, to exit from the application press "Ctrl + c".
