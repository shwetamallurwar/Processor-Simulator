Simple Pipeline
===============

Steps to execute the program:

1) Important point, Add two EOF instructions at the end of input program file.
   EOF instructions are used to identify end of program. Program will run into
   infinite loop if you dont add the EOF instructions at the end of program.
   One can find sample example in samplesPrograms directory.

2) How to compile the project?
   execute the command "make all" in the current directory. This command 
   will compile the project.

3) "make clean" is used to remove all .class files.

4) How to run the program?
   make sure all the input files are in the current directory.Program using
   abstract window toolkit to display memory registers contents, make sure 
   DISPLAY variable is set or you are on local machine.

   To run the program execute following command:
   ./sim_t arch_param_file init_mem_file assembly_file output_file

   Program generates lots of debug information on command prompt. At the end,
   output_file will be generated with the results.
